Areas of application include: the comparison of samples; the comparison of distributions; the presentation of results on sensitivities of statistical methods; the analysis of collections of contrasts and of collections of sample variances; the assessment of multivariate contrasts; and the structuring of analysis of variances; mean squares. Many of the objectives and techniques are illustrated by examples.}",
